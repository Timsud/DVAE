# Denoising Criterion for Variational Auto-encoding Framework 


Python (Theano) implementation of Denoising Criterion for Variational Auto-encoding Framework code provided 
by Daniel Jiwoong Im, Sungjin Ahn, Roland Memisevic, and Yoshua Bengio.
The codes include experiments on hodge decomposition, in particular convservative components (for now),
and vector field deformations in 2D. For more information, see
